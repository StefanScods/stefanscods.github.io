            GameBoy / GameBoy Colour Emulator
        </a>
        <div class="project-body">
            A mostly complete Nintendo GameBoy and GameBoy Colour emulator written in C++. Along with the emulator core, I have implemented 
            a custom GUI using WxWidgets which visualizes the various hardware elements along with a basic debugger for the emulated CPU.
